Desc:

This tiny mod removes a restriction to augment psi gifted soldiers and officers.
Chopping a psi soldier seems to be fine, he loses all learned psi skills.
Chopping an officer is a bit wonky, MECs will keep an officer rank but will lose all learned officer skills and some Command charges

Tested on Windows 7 x64, LongWar 1.0
======================================================================

USAGE:

You may edit mod file to allow only chop psionics or only officers. By default chopping both is allowed

Install Chop Psionics and Officers.txt with PatcherGUI. 
If it doesn't work uninstall it and then install Chop Psionics and Officers2.txt

It should work. If it doesn't - please report a bug on Nexus page of the mod: www.nexusmods.com/xcom/mods/677
