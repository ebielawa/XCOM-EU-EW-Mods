Configurable alien squad and SHIV XP mods
=========================================

DefaultStrategyAIMod.ini allows to configure a lot of parameters for alien squad, like species and numbers.

DefaultSHIVXP.ini allows to configure amount of XP gained by soldiers when SHIV kills the alien.
Soldier should see both the SHIV and its victim to gain XP. Amount of XP gained is equal to normal kill XP for
the soldier multiplied by SHIV_KILL_MOD.
