	Better Blueshirts is intended to do just as the title suggests.  It never made
	sense to me that Base Security would grab only ballistic weapons and standard armor
	(In Long War Beam and Phalanx with foundry upgrade).  Now with this mod those same
	foundry projects will now give the Blueshirts even better equipment, it only makes
	sense for soldiers to grab the best thing available right?
