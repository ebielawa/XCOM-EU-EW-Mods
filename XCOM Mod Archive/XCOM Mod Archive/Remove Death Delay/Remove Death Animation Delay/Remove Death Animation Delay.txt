MOD_NAME=Remove Death Animation Delay
AUTHOR=Peasly Wellbott
DESCRIPTION=Prevents units from flinching before they die. If you want to do it manually, find "97 01 AA 91 00 00 25 16" and replace with "96 01 AA 91 00 00 25 16". Aw yeah, unique 9 byte strings and a change that doesn't require any jump repairs. If only it could all be so easy.

/* Nullifies a check in XcomGame.XGaction_Death, preventing the completion of previous animations. Or something. All this animation stuff is over my head, frankly, but I messed around until I got the desired result. */
